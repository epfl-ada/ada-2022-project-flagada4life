## Abstract <a name="Abstract"></a>

(Draft)

The film industry has a huge impact on society. As many people watch movies, they can impact people's representation of the world and thus the path they choose in life. For example, if a girl does not see any women in movies play roles of lawyers, and does not have women lawyers in her relatives, she will probably never consider studying law when growing up.

We can also expect society to have a great impact on movie industry, as many movie scenari are inspired by real stories and by how society is shaped. Such an hypothesis implies that women's role in the movie industry should change with their place in the society. 

Our definition of women's role in movie industry include the following quantities :

- Importance of the role : Is the actor/actress playing a main character in the movie ? 
  This metric can be used to assess if men regularly get more important roles in movies.
- Age of the role : At what (actor/actress) age is played the role ? 
  This quantity is used to see if women and men age influence differently the roles they obtain.
- Qualitative aspect of women role 
  Assess how women characters are described differently than men characters.
- Importance of women in public opinion on movies
  Assess if public opinion is biased towards men opinions or women opinions. Who judges the quality of a movie?

We want to explore these characteristics accross time ( DEFINE PERIOD ), in different movie industries (Europe, Bollywood, and Holywood, and also trhoughout the different movie genres.


## Research Questions <a name="Research_questions"></a>

ARGUMENT ON FEASIBILITY OR CHANGE THE QUESTIONS

1) Do women receive more important movie roles currently than in the past?

2) Are feminine characters described differently as the ones played by men ? (adjectives, action verbs, ...)

3) Is the gender gap (assuming there is one) bigger in some genres than in others?

4) Are there more disparities between women and men actors in different regions of the world (Hollywood, Bolywood, Europe) ?

5) Are imdb ratings biased towards male or female opinion ?

These questions imply that we need to define :
- metrics for evaluating the importance of a movie role
- comparison criteria in terms of how women and men are described
- all metrics for defining the size of the gender gap
-



## Proposed additional datasets <a name="Proposed_additional_datasets_and_files"></a>

Probably keep : 

- Can scrape the ratings per gender from imdb : https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/track-movies-tv/how-can-i-view-the-breakdown-of-ratings/GZ9RAH4MHBYJWF42?ref_=helpart_nav_14#

- https://datasets.imdbws.com/ main actors also, review

Note: There are tools like "gender guesser" which give the gender based on a name. Seems reliable, maybe not for specific persons. 

Probably not use but maybe:

- https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies Have main actor
- https://github.com/taubergm/HollywoodGenderData Have director gender
