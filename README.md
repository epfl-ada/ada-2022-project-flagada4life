## Abstract <a name="Abstract"></a>

## Research Questions <a name="Research_questions"></a>

ARGUMENT ON FEASIBILITY OR CHANGE THE QUESTIONS

1) Do women receive more important movie roles currently than in the past?

2) Are feminine characters described differently as the ones played by men ? (adjectives, action verbs, ...)

3) Is the gender gap (assuming there is one) bigger in some genres than in others?

4) Are there more disparities between women and men actors in different regions of the world (Hollywood, Bolywood, Europe) ?

These questions imply that we need to define :
- metrics for evaluating the importance of a movie role
- comparison criteria in terms of how women and men are described
- all metrics for defining the size of the gender gap
-
