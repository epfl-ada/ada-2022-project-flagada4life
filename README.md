**Title:** Comparative study of women and men roles in cinema.

**Abstract:** 
The goal of this project is to try to find and evaluate and describe qualitatively as well as quantitatively the difference in men and women's roles in the movie industry. To answer this problematic we would use the database named CMU Movie Summary Corpus, which contains informations about a vast number of films, including the actors involved, their age, their genre, but also a small summary of the movie. We would compile all these data to extract interesting informations. 
 
 
**Research Questions:**
We've come to define some questions that we would like to answer during this project.
-Are feminine characters described differently as the ones played by men? 

-Are women younger than men in cinema (by movie genre, period, geographical region)? 

-Is there a difference in the career path taken men and women actors? For example, do women get to play in high revenue movies earlier than men?

These questions are important because society impact movies and movies have an impact on society too. Seeing how male and female characters are depicted could get us some interesting intel on the state of society. As we have data for movies that came out at different times, we could also track how women roles in movies have evolved through time.


**Additionnal dataset:**
Imdb dataset ? for india ??


**Methods:**
To compute the actor's age we would simply sort the dataset by a charateristic, and then compute some means, confidence intervals... 
Then to compare the description of male and female characters in the summaries we would apply some natural language processing analysis, so that we can extract the sentiment associated to a specific character, and then compare trends for men and women, and also compare the value over time and the movie genre. 


**Proposed timeline:**
